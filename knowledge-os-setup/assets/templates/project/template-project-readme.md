# Project: <% tp.file.folder() %>

## Purpose
What this project produces and for whom.

## Status
Current phase. What's blocked, what's next.

## Sensitivity tier
- [ ] Standard (Tier 1) — lives in second-brain via symlink
- [ ] NDA / confidential (Tier 2) — `_private/`, excluded from search and sync
- [ ] Sensitive / regulated (Tier 3) — separate air-gapped vault

## Vault contents
- `specs/` — what we're building
- `scopes/` — implementation boundaries
- `execution-logs/` — what actually happened
- `lessons/` — extracted learnings (promote to shared-intelligence)
- `.vault-config.md` — agent-facing context boundary

## What an agent reading this vault needs to know

### Suggested by VIS extractions

Source notes flagged with this project in their `relevant-projects:` frontmatter. Review periodically; if a source's content is genuinely useful, promote a link to it (or to one of its derived artifacts) into the manual list above.

*(v1 scope: surfaces source notes only. Tools, tactics, and patterns derived from a relevant source are reachable via that source's "Extracted artifacts" section. See `phase-3-plus-queue.md` item #2 for the v2 upgrade criteria.)*
